When comparing the new provisions to those argued in the Bedford case, there are clear connections that can be used to prove them unconstitutional.
With regards to S 286.1, its effect is like that of the communicating provision from Bedford. While it does not directly target workers, by making it criminal to solicit services it forces the industry underground. This will have the same consequences as the communicating provision, such as rushing interactions and creating an environment where police are a threat instead of resource. However, this provision would likely exacerbate these issues, as now the client is also at legal risk and many would further rush key safety steps out of fear. Furthermore, this would affect the ability of workers to keep records for safety, as those records could incriminate clients. With the same consequences comes the same outcome: an increased risk of injury or death for workers. Due to the extreme similarity of the effects, the ruling regarding the communicating provision from Bedford would more than likely apply to this section, striking it down.
While somewhat less impactful, S 213(1.1) would also have similar implications to the Bedford’s Communicating provision. As it prevents workers from working in public places, this forces them into more secluded areas or requires that clients be acquired online, which increases their risk. As was concluded by the Bedford case, preventing a “public nuisance” does not outweigh the increased health risk for workers.
